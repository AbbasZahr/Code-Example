# Code-Example - Assignment 3 Description
Assignment 3 involved using MATLAB to programm certain functions such as Image cropping, plotting histograms for image colour channels, as well as creating a basic image identification system that utilises the calculated of Sum Squared Differences between a target object and an image in order to check if the object exists within the main image, and print the exact location of it.

Y3-S1-Rehab is my Arduino code I wrote that takes in an IR signal from a remote in order to control a mini air pump and valve, that would regulate air coming into and out of a balloon. This project task required us to create a control mechanism for a pneumatic knee exoskeleton that was currently being prototyped by an academic at the University. While or initial aim was to make a control unit that unitilsed arduino's PWM functionality to control pumps and regulators that were installed on an existing prototype, we had run out of time and decided to simulate the knee exoskeleton on a smaller scale using the controller, pump, valve and a balloon. Refer to my Engineering portfolio provided for visuals on how the project resulted. Final Mark (15.45/20)

Statement: I would like to have an opportunity to further my software development skills with you at Image X, I believe with my current knowledge and familiarity of the vertical motion platform project, it will be a great learning experience which can also help assist advancing the project further on. If there are more questions or insights needed from me feel free to email.
